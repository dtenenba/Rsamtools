* Remaining issues (varied severity)
** pileup speed
** maxcnt issue (less severe)
See https://github.com/samtools/htslib/issues/243 and my two cents at
https://github.com/samtools/samtools/issues/29.

Note: samtoolsnew is built following directions at
http://www.htslib.org/download/; version at the time was samtool-1.2

I've used ERR127306_chr14.bam from the RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14
package.

chr14, position 91233066 has, as reported by the new samtools mpileup,
a depth of 452.

Contrast:

  mpileup -r chr14:91233066-91233066 path/to/ERR127306_chr14.bam

with

  mpileup -r chr14:91233066-91233066 -d 200 path/to/ERR127306_chr14.bam

(Hint: they're identical)

# to find the position with the max depth (not that you need to):
samtoolsnew mpileup ERR127306_chr14.bam > /tmp/chr14pileup
awk 'BEGIN { max=0; ln="wut" } { if($4 > max) { max = $4; ln = $0  } } END { print max "\n" ln }' /tmp/chr14pileup
